**Skin Disease Detection through Image Analysis**. Detection of skin disease is one of the major problems in the medical industry and can be healed and retrieved if properly diagnosed at an early point. Literature study demonstrates that different skin disease observation techniques are being used.

Identification of skin diseases is done using image analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks. It is found that by using the Convolutional neural networks we can achieve a higher accuracy rate.
